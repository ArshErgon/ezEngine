You can download Doxygen here: https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html

To generate the doxygen documentation, use the 'Doxyfile' in this directory.
Set the root folder ("ezEngine/Trunk/Documentation") as doxygens working directory.

You then find the documentation in:
ezEngine/Output/Doxygen/html/index.htm

Also install the 'Graphviz Dot Tool' for nicer graph visualizations:
